# Chicken Cross The Road

First group project while on the 4th week of <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #47 Bootcamp.

//The idea

We were challenged to develop a game in one week as the first team work project. 
The main concept of this project was to create an entertaining and ready to play game. After one long week we came up with this funny game where the simple goal is to cross the road as many times as possible without being ran over by any car.

//Tech && Methodologies

Java, Git, Ant, IntelliJ, <A/C_> Simple Graphics
